## What Is Heroes Questionnaire?

Heroes-Questionnaire is a beginner project I made starting out sampling the waters of VisualBasic.

The app's theme is based directly on Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which if you haven't seen that movie, I highly recommend it!

Specifically, a scene in the movie has a character ask our heroes 3 questions and if they answer correctly, they may cross the hanging bridge across a dangerous chasm.

Now with Heroes-Questionnaire you can similarly be asked these same questions. Now, what say you!?
